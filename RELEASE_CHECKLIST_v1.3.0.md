# Create git tag
git tag v1.3.0

# Push commits and tags
git push origin main
git push origin v1.3.0
```

**Expected output:**
- Commit created successfully
- Tag v1.3.0 created
- Pushed to GitHub

## üì¶ Publish to npm (You Need to Do)

### Step 4: Publish to npm (Required - Needs npm credentials)

```bash
cd /Users/francoislane/dev/cakemail-cli

# Verify you're logged in to npm
npm whoami
# Expected: Shows your npm username

# If not logged in:
# npm login

# Publish the package
npm publish

# Expected output:
# + @cakemail-org/cakemail-cli@1.3.0
# Package published successfully
```

**After publishing:**
- Verify on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cakemail-org/cakemail-cli
- Version should show 1.3.0
- Download count should start incrementing

### Step 5: Calculate SHA256 for Homebrew (Required after npm publish)

```bash
# Download and calculate SHA256 of the published package
curl -sL https://registry.npmjs.org/@cakemail-org/cakemail-cli/-/cakemail-cli-1.3.0.tgz | shasum -a 256

# Example output (yours will be different):
# a1b2c3d4e5f6... cakemail-cli-1.3.0.tgz
```

**Copy the SHA256 hash** - you'll need it for the next step.

## üç∫ Update Homebrew Formula (You Need to Do)

### Step 6: Update Homebrew Formula (Required)

```bash
cd ~/homebrew-cakemail/Formula

# Edit the formula file
# (Use your preferred editor: vim, nano, vscode, etc.)
```

**Update these lines in `cakemail-cli.rb`:**

```ruby
class CakemailCli < Formula
  desc "Official command-line interface for the Cakemail API"
  homepage "https://github.com/cakemail/cakemail-cli"
  url "https://registry.npmjs.org/@cakemail-org/cakemail-cli/-/cakemail-cli-1.3.0.tgz"
  sha256 "REPLACE_WITH_SHA256_FROM_STEP_5"
  license "MIT"

  depends_on "node"

  def install
    system "npm", "install", *std_npm_args
    bin.install_symlink Dir["#{libexec}/bin/*"]
  end

  test do
    assert_predicate bin/"cakemail", :exist?
    assert_predicate bin/"cakemail", :executable?
  end
end
```

**Then commit and push:**

```bash
cd ~/homebrew-cakemail

# Stage changes
git add Formula/cakemail-cli.rb

# Commit
git commit -m "chore: update cakemail-cli to v1.3.0

- Update version to 1.3.0
- Update SHA256 checksum
- 48 new commands added
- API coverage increased to 45%"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Test Homebrew Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Update Homebrew
brew update

# Upgrade cakemail-cli
brew upgrade cakemail-cli

# Verify version
cakemail --version
# Expected: 1.3.0

# Test a new command
cakemail reports --help
# Expected: Shows reports subcommands
```

## üéâ Post-Release (Optional but Recommended)

### Step 8: Create GitHub Release (Optional)

1. Go to: https://github.com/cakemail/cakemail-cli/releases/new
2. Select tag: `v1.3.0`
3. Release title: `v1.3.0 - Analytics & Data Operations`
4. Description: Copy content from `RELEASE_v1.3.0.md`
5. Click "Publish release"

### Step 9: Announce Release (Optional)

**Internal:**
- Email team with release notes
- Post in Slack/Teams
- Update internal documentation

**External:**
- Tweet about the release
- Post on company blog
- Update product documentation
- Notify key users/customers

## ‚ùå What I Cannot Do (Requires Your Action)

I cannot directly execute these commands because:

1. **npm run build** - Requires terminal access with proper permissions
2. **npm publish** - Requires npm authentication/credentials
3. **git push** - Requires Git authentication (SSH key or token)
4. **Homebrew formula update** - Requires GitHub push access

These are the tasks that **only you can do**. Everything else (code, documentation, planning) has been completed.

## üìä Release Summary

**What's Ready:**
- ‚úÖ All 48 commands implemented and coded
- ‚úÖ All documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Version numbers updated (package.json, cli.ts)
- ‚úÖ CHANGELOG complete
- ‚úÖ README updated with examples
- ‚úÖ Release notes prepared

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Build the project (`npm run build`)
2. Test locally (verify commands work)
3. Commit to Git
4. Publish to npm
5. Update Homebrew formula
6. Create GitHub release (optional)

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes total

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Build fails with TypeScript errors

**Check:**
- Are all import statements correct?
- Are all SDK methods called correctly?
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date

### Command not found after build

**Check:**
- Is the command registered in `src/cli.ts`?
- Is the command file exported properly?
- Did you rebuild after changes?

### npm publish fails with 401

**Solution:**
- Run `npm login` first
- Verify you have publish rights to `@cakemail-org` scope

### Homebrew installation fails

**Check:**
- Is the SHA256 correct?
- Did you push the formula to GitHub?
- Run `brew update` to refresh
