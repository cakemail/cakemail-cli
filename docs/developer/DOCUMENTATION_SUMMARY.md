**Created:** 2025-10-11
**Purpose:** Explain how all documentation files work together

---

## 🎯 Your Questions Answered

### Q: "Will a new AI have all required context to continue work effectively?"

**A: YES.** Here's how:

1. **Start with [PROJECT_INDEX.md](./PROJECT_INDEX.md)** (10 min read)
   - Maps ALL documentation
   - Shows relationships between files
   - Provides decision trees
   - **Result:** 80% of context

2. **Then read [BACKLOG.md](../planning/BACKLOG.md)** (15 min read)
   - Self-contained feature descriptions
   - Clear priorities and status
   - Effort estimates and dependencies
   - **Result:** 95% of context

3. **Optional: Read detailed plans** (10-20 min each)
   - [UX_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../planning/UX_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) (for UX work)
   - [API_COVERAGE.md](../planning/API_COVERAGE.md) (for API work)
   - [PROFILE_SYSTEM_PLAN.md](../planning/cakemail-profile-system-plan.md) (for profile work)
   - **Result:** 100% of context

**Total onboarding time:** 20-45 minutes depending on depth needed.

### Q: "Are the other files referenced correctly?"

**A: YES.** Here's the verification:

```
PROJECT_INDEX.md
├── References ../../README.md ✓
├── References ./ARCHITECTURE.md ✓
├── References ../../CHANGELOG.md ✓
├── References ../planning/BACKLOG.md ✓
├── References ../planning/API_COVERAGE.md ✓
├── References ../planning/UX_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md ✓
├── References ../planning/cakemail-profile-system-plan.md ✓
└── References ./CONTRIBUTING.md ✓

BACKLOG.md
├── References UX_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md ✓ (line 78)
├── References API_COVERAGE.md ✓ (line 309)
├── References cakemail-profile-system-plan.md ✓ (line 505)
├── References PROFILE_SYSTEM_TASKS.md ✓ (line 505)
├── References PROJECT_INDEX.md ✓ (line 1070)
├── References CHANGELOG.md ✓ (line 1072)
└── Self-contained descriptions ✓ (can work standalone)
```

**All cross-references are valid and working.**

### Q: "Does BACKLOG.md work well in pair with CHANGELOG.md?"

**A: YES.** They form a **Past ← → Future** relationship:

```
CHANGELOG.md                  BACKLOG.md
(PAST - Shipped)              (FUTURE - Planned)
─────────────────             ─────────────────

v1.4.0 ✅                     v1.4.0 remaining ⚠️
- Enhanced output            - Interactive auth setup
- Smart defaults              - Natural date parsing
- Confirmations               - Quickstart wizard

v1.3.0 ✅                     v1.5.0 planned 📋
- Reports                     - Profile system
- Segments                    - Email preview
- Import/Export               - Search commands

v1.2.0 ✅                     v1.6.0+ planned 📋
...                           - Workflows
                              - Shell completion
                              - Config management
```

**Synchronization Process** (documented in [BACKLOG.md](../planning/BACKLOG.md) lines 995-1039):

1. **Planning:** Feature in [BACKLOG.md](../planning/BACKLOG.md) → Status: NOT STARTED
2. **Dev:** [BACKLOG.md](../planning/BACKLOG.md) → Status: IN PROGRESS
3. **Complete:** [BACKLOG.md](../planning/BACKLOG.md) → Status: ✅ COMPLETED + [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) → [Unreleased]
4. **Release:** [BACKLOG.md](../planning/BACKLOG.md) → Remove/Archive + [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) → [v1.X.0]

**This ensures:**
- ✅ No features get lost
- ✅ Clear audit trail
- ✅ Easy to see what's done vs planned
- ✅ Automatic documentation

---

### Q: "How can we ensure this works long-term?"

**A: Built-in maintenance process:**

### Weekly Maintenance (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Update BACKLOG.md statuses
grep "IN PROGRESS" docs/planning/BACKLOG.md  # Check active work
# Mark completed items [x]

# 2. Move completed to CHANGELOG.md
# Copy from BACKLOG completed items → CHANGELOG [Unreleased]

# 3. Update PROJECT_INDEX.md "Current State"
# Reflect latest version and status
```

### Before Each Release (30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Finalize CHANGELOG.md
# Move [Unreleased] → [v1.X.0] with date

# 2. Archive BACKLOG.md completed items
# Remove ✅ COMPLETED items or move to "Recently Completed"

# 3. Update all version numbers
# package.json, docs/developer/PROJECT_INDEX.md, docs/planning/BACKLOG.md

# 4. Follow marketing checklist in docs/planning/BACKLOG.md (lines 963-989)
```

### Quarterly Review (1-2 hours)
```bash
# 1. Review all docs for accuracy
# 2. Archive outdated planning docs to docs/planning/archive/
# 3. Update priority matrix in docs/planning/BACKLOG.md
# 4. Clean up duplicate/obsolete docs
# 5. Verify all cross-references still valid
```

# BACKLOG.md
### Natural Date Parsing
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
[same details]
```

### Week 4: Completion
```markdown
# BACKLOG.md
### Natural Date Parsing
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

# CHANGELOG.md
## [Unreleased]
### Added - Natural Date Parsing
- Accept "tomorrow 10am", "next Monday", "+2 days"

**Example:**
$ cakemail campaigns schedule 123 --date "tomorrow 10am"
Parsed "tomorrow 10am" as Oct 12, 2025 10:00 AM EDT
✓ Campaign scheduled
```

### Week 5: Release v1.5.0
```markdown
# CHANGELOG.md
## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-20

[Full description from Unreleased]

# BACKLOG.md
[Remove or mark ✅ SHIPPED v1.5.0]
```
