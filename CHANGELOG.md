## [1.7.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added - OAuth Authentication & Profile Enhancements

**OAuth Token-Based Authentication**
- Migrated from password-based to OAuth token authentication
- Access tokens and refresh tokens now stored in config file
- Token expiration tracking with `expires_in` field
- Automatic token refresh support (foundation for future implementation)
- Enhanced authentication flow with better error handling
- Account selection prompt when multiple accounts are available
- Improved first-time authentication experience

**Logout Command**
- `logout` - Log out and clear all authentication tokens
- Interactive confirmation prompt showing current user and what will be deleted
- `--force` flag to skip confirmation for scripting
- Gracefully handles case when user is already logged out
- Deletes entire config file including profile settings

**Profile-Based List Defaults**
- Marketer profile now defaults to 25 items per page (instead of API default 50)
- Marketer profile now sorts lists by newest first (`-created_on`)
- Applied to all list commands: campaigns, contacts, lists, senders, etc.
- Created reusable `applyListDefaults()` helper for consistent behavior
- Maintains backward compatibility with explicit `--limit` and `--sort` flags

**Enhanced Help System**
- `cakemail --help` now works without requiring authentication
- `cakemail --version` works without authentication
- Subcommand help (e.g., `cakemail config --help`) works without authentication
- Bare `cakemail` command still triggers authentication as intended
- Early return optimization for help/version commands

**Improved Configuration Display**
- `config profile` now shows all available quick actions including logout
- Added "View all" quick action for `config show` command
- Better organized help text with clear command examples
- Shows current profile and all active settings

### Fixed

**Date Display Issues**
- Fixed Unix timestamp conversion (seconds to milliseconds)
- Timestamps no longer show as 1970-01-01 dates
- Proper date formatting in all output modes (JSON, table, compact)
- Fixed in authentication tokens, campaign dates, and contact timestamps

**Profile Persistence**
- Fixed profile setting not being saved during authentication
- Profile selection now properly persists to config file
- Enhanced OAuth flow to maintain profile choice

**SDK Parameter Mapping**
- Fixed parameter naming inconsistencies across SDK services
- Senders command now correctly maps `per_page` to `perPage`
- Ensures all list commands work with profile defaults

### Changed

**Authentication Flow**
- Email/password flow now returns OAuth tokens instead of storing password
- Config file now stores `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and `expires_in`
- Password is never stored in config file (security improvement)
- Authentication method tracked in config (`password` or `token`)
- Profile selection integrated into initial authentication flow

**Configuration Structure**
- Added `auth.access_token` field (replaces legacy `token` field)
- Added `auth.refresh_token` field for token refresh
- Added `auth.expires_in` field for expiration tracking
- Added `auth.method` field to track authentication method
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy `token` field

**List Command Behavior**
- All list commands now respect profile-based defaults
- Marketer profile provides more curated experience with smaller page sizes
- Developer profile still uses API defaults (50 items, default sort)
- Explicit flags (`--limit`, `--sort`) always override profile defaults

### Technical Improvements

- Profile config uses lazy evaluation pattern for runtime overrides

### Configuration Priority
```
CLI flags (--profile, --batch) > Env vars > Custom overrides > Profile defaults > Hard-coded defaults
```

### Example Usage

**Switch Profiles:**
```bash
cakemail config profile-set developer  # Fast, scriptable, no interruptions
cakemail config profile-set marketer   # Guided, interactive, safe

Campaign name: Weekly Newsletter
? Select a list: ‚Ä∫ Newsletter Subscribers (1,234 contacts)
? Select a sender: ‚Ä∫ Marketing Team <marketing@company.com>
‚úì Campaign created: 789
```

# Before (required list-id):
$ cakemail contacts list 123

# After (auto-detects if you have one list):
$ cakemail contacts list
Auto-detected list: 123 (My Newsletter List)
[shows contacts]

# Multiple resources scenario:
$ cakemail contacts list
Multiple lists found. Please specify --list-id <id>
Available lists:
  123: Newsletter List
  456: Product Updates
```
