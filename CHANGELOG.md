## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added - Seamless Authentication, Multi-Tenant Support & Enhanced Output

**Enhanced Output Formatting - Visual Polish**
- JSON syntax highlighting with color-coded keys, values, booleans, and nulls
- Color-coded status badges with emoji indicators for quick visual scanning
- Relative time formatting for dates (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")
- Number formatting with thousands separators (1,234 instead of 1234)
- Enhanced pagination display showing item ranges and page navigation hints
- Better null/empty value handling with visual indicators (‚Äî)
- Status-specific colors and emoji:
  - Campaigns: üü¢ sent, üîµ scheduled, üü° sending, ‚ö™ draft, üî¥ failed
  - Contacts: ‚úì active, ‚úó unsubscribed, ‚ö† bounced
  - Senders: ‚úì confirmed, ‚è≥ pending
- Smart field truncation for long values in table/compact views
- Bold column headers and improved table styling
- Compact mode now shows status badges and metadata inline
- Warning method added to OutputFormatter for consistency

**Pagination Enhancements:**
```bash
# Before:
Total: 150 items
[table data]

# After:
Showing 1-25 of 150 ‚Ä¢ Page 1 of 6
[table data with colored status badges]

üí° Next: --page 2
```

**Status Badge Examples:**
- Campaign list: Shows "üü¢ sent" instead of just "sent"
- Sender list: Shows "‚úì Yes" or "‚è≥ Pending" for confirmation status
- Contact list: Shows "‚úì active" or "‚úó unsubscribed"

### Added - Seamless Authentication & Multi-Tenant Support

**Interactive Authentication**
- Seamless inline authentication prompts when credentials are missing
- No separate setup command required - authenticate on first use
- Interactive email/password prompts using inquirer
- Automatic credential validation via API
- Credentials automatically saved to `.env` file
- Welcome message shows total accessible accounts

**Multi-Tenant Account Management (5 new commands)**
- `account show` - Display current account details
- `account list` - List all accessible accounts (parent + sub-accounts)
- `account use <id>` - Switch active account context
- `account test` - Validate current credentials
- `account logout --force` - Remove credentials from .env

**Account Context Management**
- New `CAKEMAIL_CURRENT_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable
- Global `--account <id>` flag to override context per-command
- Account context persists in `.env` file between sessions

**Progress Indicators for Long-Running Operations**
- Visual progress bars for bulk operations (batch tagging, multiple deletes)
- Polling progress with elapsed time and attempt tracking for async exports
- Multi-step progress indicators for complex workflows
- `--no-wait` flag for export commands to return immediately
- Progress utilities: `PollingProgress`, `BatchProgress`, `MultiStepProgress`, `pollUntilComplete()`

**Enhanced Error Handling & Validation**
- User-friendly error messages with context-aware suggestions
- HTTP status code mapping (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429, 500, 502, 503)
- Error pattern matching for common scenarios (network errors, email validation, resource not found)
- Pre-flight validation helpers: email format, ID validation, date format, required fields, JSON parsing
- Colored output with actionable help text and command suggestions
- Enhanced error display in commands: campaigns, lists, reports, contacts, senders

**Example Error Messages:**
```
‚úó Error: Campaign not found
‚Üí Campaign with ID '999' doesn't exist
üí° Tip: To see all campaigns, use: cakemail campaigns list
```

**Interactive Confirmations for Destructive Operations**
- Interactive Y/N prompts for all delete operations (13 commands enhanced)
- Visual danger indicators (‚ö†) with clear warnings about what will be deleted
- Context-specific details about consequences (e.g., "All contacts will be deleted")
- Graceful cancellation with informative messages
- `--force` flag still available for automation/scripting purposes
- Consistent confirmation UX across all destructive operations

**Enhanced Commands with Interactive Confirmations:**
- `campaigns delete` - Warns about permanent deletion

**Smart Defaults - Auto-Detection of Resources**
- Auto-detects list ID when only one list exists (14 commands enhanced)
- Auto-detects sender ID when only one confirmed sender exists (1 command)
- Session caching with 5-minute TTL for frequently used resources
- Helpful suggestions when multiple resources exist
- Zero-configuration workflow for single-list users

**Commands with Smart Defaults (list-id now optional):**
- `contacts list [list-id]` - Auto-detects list
- `contacts add [list-id]` - Auto-detects list
- `contacts export [list-id]` - Auto-detects list

**Example Smart Default Behavior:**
```bash
# Before (required list-id):
$ cakemail contacts list 123

# After (auto-detects if you have one list):
$ cakemail contacts list
Auto-detected list: 123 (My Newsletter List)
[shows contacts]

# Multiple resources scenario:
$ cakemail contacts list
Multiple lists found. Please specify --list-id <id>
Available lists:
  123: Newsletter List
  456: Product Updates
```

- Progress indicators provide real-time feedback for long operations
- Error messages guide users toward resolution with specific suggestions
- Interactive confirmations make destructive operations safer while maintaining scriptability with `--force`
