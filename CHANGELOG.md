## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added - Complete Profile System

**Three User Profiles with Adaptive Behavior**
- **Developer Profile**: JSON output, minimal colors, no prompts, no confirmations, ISO8601 dates, verbose errors, show API details
- **Marketer Profile**: Compact output, rich colors, interactive prompts, confirmations, relative dates, friendly errors, helpful tips
- **Balanced Profile** (Default): Table output, moderate colors, auto-detect prompts, confirmations, friendly dates, balanced errors

**Profile Management Commands (6 commands)**
- `config profile` - Show current profile and all settings
- `config profile-set <type>` - Switch to different profile (developer|marketer|balanced)
- `config preview <type>` - Preview profile settings without switching
- `config set <key> <value>` - Customize individual settings
- `config reset` - Reset all settings to profile defaults
- `config show` - Show complete configuration including auth and defaults

**Interactive Prompt System**
- Smart environment detection (TTY, CI, batch mode)
- Profile-aware prompts that respect user preferences
- Interactive text, number, select, multi-select, confirm, and password prompts
- Automatic prompt suppression in non-interactive environments
- `promptText()`, `promptNumber()`, `promptSelect()`, `promptMultiSelect()`, `promptConfirm()`, `promptPassword()`

**Smart Resource Selection with Interactive Prompts**
- `campaigns create` - Interactive prompts for campaign name, list selection, and sender selection
- `lists create` - Interactive prompt for list name and optional language
- Auto-detects single resources (lists, senders) or shows interactive selection menu
- Displays resource details during selection (e.g., "Newsletter List (1,234 contacts)")

**Profile-Aware Confirmations**
- Developer profile: Skip all confirmations (trusts the developer)
- Marketer profile: Always confirm destructive operations (safety first)
- Balanced profile: Confirm in interactive mode, skip in scripts
- Automatic confirmation suppression in CI/batch environments

**Global CLI Flags**
- `--profile <type>` - Override profile for single command without switching
- `--batch` - Explicit scripting mode (disable all interactive prompts)
- Works with all commands: `cakemail --profile developer campaigns list`

**Profile-Aware Output Features**
- Color schemes: none (no colors), minimal (red/green only), moderate, rich (full colors)
- Date formats: iso8601 (machine-readable), friendly (human-readable), relative (time ago)
- Error messages: technical (developer) vs friendly (marketer) based on profile
- Progress indicators: shown/hidden based on profile settings
- Tips and hints: enabled for marketer, disabled for developer

**Configuration Storage**
- Profile settings stored in `~/.cakemail/config.json`
- Automatic migration from `.env` to config file
- Profile selection integrated into first-time auth flow
- Backward compatible with existing `.env` configurations

### Changed
- `OutputFormatter` now accepts profile config getter for adaptive behavior
- `confirmDelete()` and related functions now accept optional `profileConfig` parameter
- Interactive prompts automatically skip in non-TTY and CI environments
- `campaigns create` and `lists create` now have optional `--name` parameter (prompts if missing)
- All confirmation functions now respect profile settings
- Error display adapts to profile (technical vs friendly)
- Spinners adapt to profile (shown/hidden based on `show_progress` setting)

### Technical Improvements
- Created `src/types/profile.ts` - Complete profile type system with 3 profiles
- Created `src/utils/config-file.ts` - Profile config storage and management
- Created `src/utils/interactive.ts` - Interactive prompt system with environment detection
- Enhanced `src/utils/confirm.ts` - Profile-aware confirmations
- Enhanced `src/utils/errors.ts` - Profile-aware error messages
- Enhanced `src/commands/campaigns.ts` - Interactive create with smart resource selection
- Enhanced `src/commands/lists.ts` - Interactive create
- Added `getProfile()` public method to `OutputFormatter`
- Profile config uses lazy evaluation pattern for runtime overrides

### Configuration Priority
```
CLI flags (--profile, --batch) > Env vars > Custom overrides > Profile defaults > Hard-coded defaults
```

### Example Usage

**Switch Profiles:**
```bash
cakemail config profile-set developer  # Fast, scriptable, no interruptions
cakemail config profile-set marketer   # Guided, interactive, safe
cakemail config profile-set balanced   # Best of both worlds (default)
```

**Preview Before Switching:**
```bash
cakemail config preview developer  # See what developer mode looks like
```

**Override Profile Once:**
```bash
cakemail --profile developer campaigns list  # Use developer mode just once
cakemail --batch campaigns create ...        # Disable prompts for this command
```

**Interactive Campaign Creation (Marketer Profile):**
```bash
$ cakemail campaigns create
Campaign name: Weekly Newsletter
? Select a list: ‚Ä∫ Newsletter Subscribers (1,234 contacts)
? Select a sender: ‚Ä∫ Marketing Team <marketing@company.com>
‚úì Campaign created: 789
```

**Scripted Campaign Creation (Developer Profile):**
```bash
$ cakemail campaigns create --name "Weekly Newsletter" --list-id 123 --sender-id 456
{"id":789,"name":"Weekly Newsletter","status":"draft"}
```

### Documentation
- Reorganized all documentation into `/docs` structure
- Created comprehensive user manual with 11 sections
- Added developer documentation (ARCHITECTURE, AUTH, CONTRIBUTING)
- Added planning documents (BACKLOG, PROFILE_SYSTEM_TASKS)
- Archived old documentation for reference

### Notes
- **No breaking changes** - All existing commands remain compatible
- Profile system is opt-in - balanced profile is the default
- Developers can use `--profile developer` for fast, non-interactive behavior
- Marketers get guided experience with safety confirmations
- Scripts automatically detect non-TTY and skip prompts
- Full backward compatibility with `.env` based configuration
