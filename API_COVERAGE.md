## Design Philosophy

The CLI focuses on:

1. **High-Value Commands**: Operations developers and marketers use daily
2. **Developer Experience**: Simple, intuitive commands with great error messages
3. **SDK Foundation**: Built on official SDK for reliability and maintainability
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features first, advanced features via SDK

**Note:** The full SDK provides 100% API coverage. CLI commands are added based on user demand and common use cases.

---

## Output Formats

All commands support three output formats:

- **JSON** (default): Full structured data
- **Table**: Formatted table view
- **Compact**: One-line summaries

Set default format: `CAKEMAIL_OUTPUT_FORMAT=compact` in `.env`
Override per command: `cakemail -f table campaigns list`

---

## Advanced Filtering and Sorting

All list commands support:

- **Sorting**: `--sort "+name"` or `--sort "-created_on"`
- **Filtering**: `--filter "status==active;name==Newsletter"`
- **Pagination**: `-l 50 -p 2` (50 per page, page 2)
