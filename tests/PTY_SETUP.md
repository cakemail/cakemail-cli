# PTY Testing Setup Status

## Current Status: ⚠️ Node Version Compatibility Issue

PTY tests are **ready to use** but currently cannot run due to a Node.js version compatibility issue.

### The Issue

- **Your Node Version**: v24.10.0
- **node-pty Compatibility**: Supports Node 18.x and 20.x only
- **Error**: node-pty fails to compile on Node 24.x (too new)

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Switch to Node 20 (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Node 20 LTS
nvm install 20
nvm use 20

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Run PTY tests
npm run test:pty
```

#### Option 2: Use Node 18 LTS

```bash
# Install Node 18 LTS
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Run PTY tests
npm run test:pty
```

#### Option 3: Wait for node-pty Update

Monitor the node-pty repository for Node 24 support:
https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/issues

### What Works Now

✅ **Integration Tests**: Tests that make real API calls work perfectly
```bash
npm run test:integration  # ✅ Works (5 tests passing)
```

✅ **CLI Build**: CLI compiles and runs successfully
```bash
npm run build  # ✅ Works
./dist/cli.js campaigns list  # ✅ Works
```

✅ **Mock Server**: Express-based mock server is ready (tests/helpers/mock-server.ts)

✅ **PTY Helpers**: Helper functions are ready (tests/helpers/pty-runner.ts)

✅ **Example Tests**: Complete test suite ready (tests/pty/campaigns.test.ts)

### What's Ready But Can't Run

⏳ **PTY Tests**: 13 tests in tests/pty/campaigns.test.ts
- Tests real terminal simulation
- Tests colors, spinners, formatting
- Tests all output profiles
- Needs node-pty to run

### Testing Strategy Until PTY Works

1. **For CLI functionality**: Use integration tests (real API)
2. **For output formatting**: Test manually with real CLI
3. **For CI/CD**: Use Node 20 in CI environment

```bash
# In CI (GitHub Actions example)
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
```

### File Structure

```

└── pty/

```

### What Was Cleaned Up

✅ Removed nock-based mocking (doesn't work with subprocess)
✅ Removed 147 ineffective e2e tests
✅ Removed outdated documentation
✅ Simplified test setup files
✅ Updated package.json dependencies

---

**Next Steps**: Switch to Node 20 to enable PTY testing, or continue with integration tests on Node 24.
